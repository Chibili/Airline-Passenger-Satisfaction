# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Predictive Model

By: Richard Cornelius Suwandi & Chibili Mugala

Start Date: 21/07/2020

### Project Summary

The aviation industry, like most fast-paced businesses, requires swift action to retain or attract customers. With the aid of data analytics, creating a business model that reflects on customer demands through uncovering patterns in a data-driven model is paramount. Through the exploration of both univariate and multivariate analysis, this study will uncover hidden patterns and reveal key insights that will have a huge significance on which predictor variables will be preferred in the final model. 

Other essential tasks will involve correlation tests; this will generate a mapping of variables in relation to multicollinearity. Variables with high variance from the "Satisfaction" independent variable will play a vital role in the modeling stage while ones with little or no variance will be excluded. 

Understanding the service dimensions such as "Leg Room Service", "Inflight Entertainment", "On-board Service" and "Checkin Service" will possibly lead to feature engineering. The target variable (Satisfaction) can undergo data transformation through either label encoding with "Yes" or "No" (0 or 1) outcomes. 

Correspondingly, we will treat this as a binary classification problem, where we will try to create a model that predicts whether the customer is satisfied or not with the experience and/or service provided by the airline.

The following sections will illustrate the steps taken to develop the model;

### I. Data Collection

The Airline Passenger Satisfaction data was collected from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction). 

### II. Data Cleaning

Based on the data, there are several things that we need to do to prepare the data before fitting it to a model. There are a few categorical variables that need to be encoded, including the target variable "Satisfaction". There are also a couple of columns that can be dropped, such as "Unnamed: 0" and "id", since they don't contain useful information.

### III. Exploratory Data Analysis




### IV. Modeling Data



### V. Data Interpretation
